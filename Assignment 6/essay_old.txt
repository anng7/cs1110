Thoughts

Detection: Marker should be short--Since I'm planning on encoding the length of
the message immediately after the marker, the odds of mistakenly recognizing a
nonexistent message are fairly low. Moreover, the user will be able to quickly
detect if their isn't a genuine message in the image-- the output will likely be
a string of random characters.
^ Calculate odds of false detection

Length: The length of the message should be embedded in the front of the message.
In the event of false detection, the program should also check to make sure the
length of the message does not exceed the number of available pixels.

Color values exceeding 255: Implement a simple conditional that subtracts from
a color component if it exceeds 255 after the message has been embedded.
